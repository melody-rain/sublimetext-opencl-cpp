sublimetext-opencl-cpp
======================

I modified the syntax of sublimetext-cuda-cpp so that sublimetext can recognize the .cl file. I mainly changed the key word "cuda" to opencl and added the key words of OpenCL and removed CUDA key words. Not all OpenCL key words are included and I am still working on it.

How to use it:

Copy the OpenCL C++ folder to C:\Users\Your Account\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages.
This path is where your sublime test's "packages" folder exists. 

You can refer to https://github.com/harrism/sublimetext-cuda-cpp for CUDA version. Thanks for harrism's contribution.
