sublimetext-opencl-cpp
======================

I modified the syntax of sublimetext-cuda-cpp so that sublimetext can recognize the .cl file. I mainly changed the key word "cuda" to opencl and added the key words of OpenCL and removed CUDA key words. Not all OpenCL key words are included and I am still working on it.
